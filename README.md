# Sudoku-Solver
Simple sudoku solver.

The program takes in a 9 by 9 grid consisting of the numbers in your sudoku game and either provides a
solution if it exists or mentions that no solution exists for the proposed grid. It can be easily modified to allow the user to enter their own grid for a custom game/solution.
